Backend Framework: Spring Boot 3.x

Web Layer: Spring MVC

Security: Spring Security (for login/logout and basic authentication)

Database: MySQL

Persistence: Spring Data JPA / Hibernate

Templating: Thymeleaf

Build Tool: Maven

Language: Java 21

üõ†Ô∏è Prerequisites

Before running this application, ensure you have the following installed:

Java Development Kit (JDK) 21 or higher.

Maven 3.x

MySQL Database server running locally (e.g., MySQL 8.x).

‚öôÔ∏è Setup and Installation

Follow these steps to get the CCMS up and running on your local machine.

1. Database Configuration

You must create a MySQL database and update the connection details in src/main/resources/application.properties.

Create Database: Run the following SQL command in your MySQL client:

CREATE DATABASE cafeteria2;


Update application.properties: Edit the file to match your database credentials.

# 2. MySQL Datasource Configuration (UPDATE THESE VALUES)
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/cafeteria2?createDatabaseIfNotExist=true&useSSL=false&serverTimezone=UTC
spring.datasource.username=root
spring.datasource.password=Asha530680@  <-- UPDATE THIS!
spring.datasource.driver-class-name=com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver

# DDL-Auto will create all necessary tables automatically
spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update


2. Run the Application

Navigate to the project root directory in your terminal and use the Maven wrapper:

# Clean, compile, and package the application
./mvnw clean package

# Run the application (it will start on port 8085 as configured)
